# Data-Analysis-Projects
Personal Projects in which I try out different tools and algorithms to grow my knowledge in the area.

### Auto MPG
- A [database](https://code.datasciencedojo.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/tree/master/Auto%20MPG) from DataScienceDojo in which I practice different regression techniques.
- It is a multivariate database, and the point is to predict the fuel efficiency of the car

### Airline Satisfaction
- A [database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) from Kaggle in which I practice different classification techniques.
- It is a multivariate database, and the goal is to identify what factors lead to customer satisfaction or indifference.
